# notebook-composite-image
Jupyter notebook to create a composite image from covers of books from digital libraries

# Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes (BVMC)
This notebook retrieves the covers from the LOD repository of the BVMC. The authors selected in this example are [Miguel de Cervantes](http://data.cervantesvirtual.com/person/40), [Lope de Vega](http://data.cervantesvirtual.com/person/72) y [Calder√≥n de la Barca](http://data.cervantesvirtual.com/person/79)). It is possible to change the authors by changing the identifiers (data.cervantesvirtual.com/person/id) that can be retrieved at data.cervantesvirtual.com.

Then, the notebook creates a composite image with all the covers which can is accessible at [easyzoom](https://www.easyzoom.com/imageaccess/acab10e5187b45d8ad802d8d302a4901).
